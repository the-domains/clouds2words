description: "The fresh start. The open road. Beginning. These words and phrases all signal a change. I use them here because \_it's time to do things different. I have planned and hoped for too long. Now is the time for action. I want this website/blog/platform to first and foremost tell my story. My journey from inaction to creation. I am not certain where I will go yet with this. I prefer to start slow and chart my course as I go along. This is an experiment, so please do not expect perfection. I want this site to be as rough and as unedited as life is. Let us turn our day dreams into something more together. I am excited and I hope you are too."

The fresh start. The open road. Beginning. These words and phrases all signal a change. I use them here because  it's time to do things different. I have planned and hoped for too long. Now is the time for action. I want this website/blog/platform to first and foremost tell my story. **_My journey from inaction to creation._** I am not certain where I will go yet with this. I prefer to start slow and chart my course as I go along. This is an experiment, so please do not expect perfection. I want this site to be as rough and as unedited as life is. Let us turn our day dreams into something more together. I am excited and I hope you are too.
